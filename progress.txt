## Iteration 1 - Scaffold Blazor WASM app + basic project structure
- What was implemented:
  - Created Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 10) project in src/SamplingCalculator
  - Created xUnit test project in tests/SamplingCalculator.Tests
  - Created solution file (SamplingCalculator.slnx)
  - Added Models: CalculatorInput, CalculatorResult, SamplingStatus enum
  - Added Services: SamplingCalculatorService with core formulas (pixel scale, FOV, sampling classification, Dawes limit, f-ratio)
  - Built Home.razor page with Inputs panel (telescope, camera, seeing) and Results panel (pixel scale, FOV, status badge, metrics)
  - Added dark-themed CSS (app.css) with responsive 2-column layout
  - Simplified MainLayout (removed sidebar/nav), removed template pages (Counter, Weather)
  - Wrote 14 unit tests covering all calculation formulas and edge cases
- Files changed:
  - SamplingCalculator.slnx (new)
  - src/SamplingCalculator/ (new project with Models/, Services/, Pages/, Components/, Layout/)
  - tests/SamplingCalculator.Tests/ (new test project)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - .NET 10 uses .slnx format (not .sln) by default
  - Blazor WASM template includes Counter/Weather pages that should be removed
  - FOV calculation uses unbinned sensor resolution (physical pixels on sensor)

## Iteration 2 - Implement calculation engine with unit-tested formulas
- What was implemented:
  - Reviewed existing calculation engine (effective focal length, pixel scale, FOV, Dawes limit, f-ratio) — already complete from iteration 1
  - Added 6 new unit tests for comprehensive coverage:
    - Combined reducer + barlow effective focal length
    - Binning 3x3 and 4x4 pixel scale
    - FOV invariance under binning
    - Pixel scale with reducer
    - f-ratio with combined reducer + barlow
  - Total: 20 tests, all passing
- Files changed:
  - tests/SamplingCalculator.Tests/UnitTest1.cs (added 6 tests)
  - prd.md (marked task 2 as passes: true)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - PRD formula `effectiveFocal = baseFocal * barlowFactor / reducerFactor` treats reducer as divisor (0.7x reducer gives LONGER focal length, which is inverted from physical reality — but matches PRD spec)
  - FOV is binning-invariant (binning cancels out in the formula) — good property to test
  - Calculation engine was already feature-complete from iteration 1; Task 2 mainly needed test coverage expansion
