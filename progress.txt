## Iteration 1 - Scaffold Blazor WASM app + basic project structure
- What was implemented:
  - Created Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 10) project in src/SamplingCalculator
  - Created xUnit test project in tests/SamplingCalculator.Tests
  - Created solution file (SamplingCalculator.slnx)
  - Added Models: CalculatorInput, CalculatorResult, SamplingStatus enum
  - Added Services: SamplingCalculatorService with core formulas (pixel scale, FOV, sampling classification, Dawes limit, f-ratio)
  - Built Home.razor page with Inputs panel (telescope, camera, seeing) and Results panel (pixel scale, FOV, status badge, metrics)
  - Added dark-themed CSS (app.css) with responsive 2-column layout
  - Simplified MainLayout (removed sidebar/nav), removed template pages (Counter, Weather)
  - Wrote 14 unit tests covering all calculation formulas and edge cases
- Files changed:
  - SamplingCalculator.slnx (new)
  - src/SamplingCalculator/ (new project with Models/, Services/, Pages/, Components/, Layout/)
  - tests/SamplingCalculator.Tests/ (new test project)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - .NET 10 uses .slnx format (not .sln) by default
  - Blazor WASM template includes Counter/Weather pages that should be removed
  - FOV calculation uses unbinned sensor resolution (physical pixels on sensor)
